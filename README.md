Web mapping application.  
    The user can specify a date range for displaying permits. These are then displayed on the map with a little box providing the information. The values will not present on top of each other as there is a little bump loop that will take care of it.

Files:
application.py - Python file that handles the flask app and does data querying and cleaning

templates/Mappingpage.html - Mapping page where the map displaying data requested by the user is presented
