Web mapping application.  
    This is a web application to see the Calgary permits website with a new filter that shows the location of car accidents as a heat map. Due to the heat map not being everyones cup of tea, it can be turned off if it is distressing.

Files:
application.py - Python file that handles the flask app and does data querying and cleaning

templates/Mappingpage.html - Mapping page where the map displaying data requested by the user is presented
